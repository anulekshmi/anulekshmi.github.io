# a summary about you
summary: 'I am majoring in Computer Science & Engineering at VIT University. I consistently try to upskill myself for contributing towards the development of cutting-edge technologies that can substantially solve real-world problems. Glad to connect!'

#Coding has always been my passion; machine learning specifically being the area of best interest since it has exposed me to a broader range of problems that I can solve. As a part of consistently working on improving my technical and soft skills whilst accumulating a strong foundational knowledge in several domains by myself, I often engage with my friends in designing new ideas and researching or developing them through projects. I also fervently try to acquire expertise in fields like Web #and Android Development, Data Analytics, etc. as it can equip me in a better way for contributing towards the development of cutting-edge technologies that can substantially solve real-world problems.'
